# Combine the two equations: 
# sin(XY)zi2 = cos(x/y)/(zi2)
# (x^2/a^2) + (y^2/b^2) >= 1

# We'll define an example for the values of a and b (for simplicity)
a = 2
b = 3

# First equation: sin(XY)zi2 = cos(x/y)/(zi2)

# Second equation: (x^2/a^2) + (y^2/b^2) >= 1
Z2 = (X**2 / a**2) + (Y**2 / b**2)

# Combine the two equations in some meaningful way, here we'll just multiply them for illustration:
Z = Z1 * Z2

# Handle NaN and complex numbers:
Z = np.nan_to_num(Z)  # Replace NaN with 0
Z = np.real(Z)        # Discard the imaginary part if it's complex

# Ensure Z values are within a range suitable for plotting and colormap
